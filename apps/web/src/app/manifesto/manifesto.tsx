          Folks is a place for <strong>creative people</strong>{" "}
          <span className="italic">
            (designers, engineers, founders, painters, carpenters, architects,
            lighting designers and anyone else who creates something)
          </span>{" "}
          to share their creations and thoughts with each other and feel
          comfortable doing so.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want this platform to be a place where you're comfortable to share
          your creations, ask questions, and talk with the community.
        </p>

        <p>
          I plan to support this platform long-term by financing hosting,
          moderating and by managing the open-source repository. Since it is
          open-source, if for any reason I'm unable to support it anymore, it
          will be possible for someone else to take over the baton.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the future, Folks will be registered as a non-profit organization
          to ensure that the platform remains sustainable and is not driven by
          the pursuit of higher profit.
        </p>

        <strong>Contributing Code</strong>

        <p>

          adding features or fixing bugs yourself, you can find it on{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/folkscommunity/folks">GitHub</a>.
